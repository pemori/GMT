Data and script for the article published in Geoderma Regional

# Contour and Line Plots in R ðŸ“Š
This repository contains an R script (`contour+lineplots.R`) designed to show information about soil moisture in the subsoil. It also makes line plots for soil loss data.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Contour Plots:** Generate high-resolution contour plots to visualize three-dimensional data on a two-dimensional plane.
- **Line Plots:** Create line plots to depict changes and trends over time or other continuous variables.
- **Customizable:** Easy to modify code for specific datasets or visualization needs.
- **Interactive:** Explore different visualization techniques to enhance the understanding of complex data.

Example Output ðŸ“ˆ
Below is an example figure created using the script and subsequent customization in PPT.
